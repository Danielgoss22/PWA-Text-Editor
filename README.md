# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

- I wanted to create a text editor that would allow users to make code snippets whether they were connected to teh internet or not.

- I had the most issues with creating my package.json files. I realized that while working on the scripts and dependencies I needed to be careful that the correct scripts and dependencies were in the correct levels. For example we do not need to have Webpack as a dependency in the root package.json only in the client package.
